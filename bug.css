The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but it can sometimes lead to unexpected results if not used correctly. For example, if you use `calc(100% - 10px)` and the parent element's width is less than 10px, then the child element will have a negative width, potentially causing layout issues.  Another example is mixing units inconsistently, such as `calc(100px + 5em)`, which could lead to browser inconsistencies.  Also, using nested `calc()` functions can get complex and hard to debug.
